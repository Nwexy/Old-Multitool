## 📜 About This Project

This project simulates a classic "multi-tool" script that I wrote years ago when I was first getting into coding. It serves as a nostalgic archive of my early work.

**Note:** This tool was created for educational purposes and testing on local systems only.

## 🛠 Features

### 1. SMB Bruteforce (Auto)
- **Automatic Detection:** Automatically detects the current system's Username, Computer Name, and IP Address.
- **Local Attack:** Uses the native `net use` command to attempt a login on the local machine using a provided wordlist.
- **Purpose:** Demonstrates how simple SMB authentication attacks work on Windows.

### 2. IP Lookup
- **Geolocation:** Fetches detailed information about an IP address using the `ip-api.com` API.
- **Data Points:** Country, Region, City, ISP, ZIP code, and more.

### 3. Discord Webhook Spammer
- **Webhook Testing:** Sends multiple messages to a specified Discord Webhook URL.
- **Customizable:** Allows you to set the message content and the number of messages to send.

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Run `Nwex_Multitool.bat`.
2. Select an option from the menu.
3. Follow the on-screen prompts.
